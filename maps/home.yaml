      This room is full of paper and markers and general stuff that
      you cannot pick up.  You wouldn't want to anyway. Just a nice place to

  intro: |
    You find yourself in the living room of someone's home.  You need to get
    out before someone finds you walking around in their house.  Certainly
    you can figure out how to get into the backyard... if you just keep
    looking for the way out.

    Congratualations, you got out before beind spotted by the home's owners
    That's pretty fortunate!
